### The Problem

In the modern digital age, information warfare is a significant threat to national security and social cohesion. Hostile actors, both foreign and domestic, leverage social media platforms to launch coordinated campaigns aimed at spreading disinformation, inciting hatred, and destabilizing society. These campaigns are often fast-moving and difficult to detect before they cause significant harm.

### Our Solution: Project Argus

Project Argus is an early warning system designed to provide actionable intelligence to security agencies and researchers. Our platform automatically monitors public conversations, identifies potentially hostile narratives using AI, and visualizes the key actors and networks driving these campaigns.

This allows analysts to move from a reactive to a **proactive** stance, enabling them to understand and counter threats as they emerge.
